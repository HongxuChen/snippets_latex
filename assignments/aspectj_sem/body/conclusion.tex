\section{Conclusions}

This review discusses about the operational semantics of aspectj pointcuts with a reduced JVMLI set.It divides the procedure of weaving into two parts:the front-end and the back-end.We view the aspect woven as a normal java byte code file and analyze the mapping from the mixed environment of \texttt{javaEnvironment} and \texttt{aspect} into pure javaEnvironment.It also induces five rules related to the two kinds of advice.
