\section{Introduction}
% motivation for creating this theme
\begin{frame}{Introduction}{And a short subtitle}
  The present unofficial AAU beamer theme is an attempt to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> create a simple, elegant and beautiful AAU beamer theme,
    \item<2-> create a unique AAU theme which does not resemble any of the standard beamer themes; people should associate this theme with AAU and not with beamer,
    \item<3-> keep the amount of clutter to a minimum. Only the important things should be on the slides,
    \item<4-> retain the powerful customisation tools provided by the template system of the beamer class
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{License}
% the license
\begin{frame}{Introduction}{License}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> The AAU logo is probably covered by some copyright rules. I have used the logo from \chref{http://design.aau.dk}{http://design.aau.dk} and modified it slightly. As long as you use the theme for making presentations in connection with your work at AAU, I guess it is allowed to use the AAU logo.
    \item<2-> The rest of the theme is provided under the GNU General Public License v. 3 (GPLv3). This basically means that you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same license. For more information on the GPL license see \chref{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Installation}
% general installation instructions
\begin{frame}{Installation}
  The theme consists of four files
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {\tt beamerthemeaausidebar.sty}
    \item {\tt beamerinnerthemeaausidebar.sty}
    \item {\tt beamerouteraausidebar.sty}
    \item {\tt beamercoloraausidebar.sty}
  \end{enumerate}
  The theme can either be installed for local or global use.
  \pause
  \begin{block}{Local Installation}
    The simplest way of installing the theme is by placing the four theme files in the same folder as your presentation.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

% general installation instructions
\begin{frame}{Installation}
  \begin{block}{Global Installation}
  \begin{itemize}
     \item If you wish to make the theme globally available, you must put the files in your local latex directory tree. The location of the root of the local directory tree depends on the operating system and the latex distribution. On the following slides, you can read the instructions for some common setups.
    \item When you download the theme, the four theme files are embedded in a directory structure ready to be copied directly to the root of your local directory tree.
    \item On the following slides, we refer to this directory structure as {\tt <dirstruct>}. \alert{Notice} that some parts of the directory may already exist if you have installed other packages in your local latex directory tree. If this is the case, you simply merge {\tt <dirstruct>} with your existing setup.
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{GNU/Linux}
% installation on GNU/Linux
\begin{frame}{Installation}{GNU/Linux}
  \begin{block}{Ubuntu with TeX Live}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Place the {\tt <dirstruct>} in the root of your local latex directory tree. By default it is\\
        {\tt \textasciitilde /texmf}\\
        If the root does not exist, create it. The symbol {\tt \textasciitilde} refers to your home folder, i.e., {\tt /home/<username>}
      \item In a terminal run\\
        {\tt \$ texhash \textasciitilde /texmf}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Microsoft Windows}
% installation on Microsoft Windows
\begin{frame}{Installation}{Microsoft Windows}
  \begin{block}{Windows with MiKTeX}
    Apparently, MiKTeX does not include a local latex directory tree by default. Therefore, you first have to create it.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item To do this, create a folder {\tt <somewhere>} named, e.g., {\tt texmf}
      \item Add this folder in the Roots tab of the MiKTeX Settings dialog
      \item Place the {\tt <dirstruct>} in your newly created local latex directory tree\\
    {\tt <somewhere>\textbackslash texmf}\\
      \item Open the MiKTeX Settings dialog and click Refresh FNDB.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% installation on Microsoft Windows Cont'd
\begin{frame}{Installation}{Microsoft Windows}
  \begin{block}{Windows with TeX Live}
    In the advanced TeX Live Installer, you can manually change the default position of the root of the local latex directory tree. However, we assume the default position below.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Place the {\tt <dirstruct>} in your local latex directory tree\\
        {\tt \%USERPROFILE\%\textbackslash texmf}\\
        If it does not exist, create it. In XP {\tt \%USERPROFILE\%} is\\
      {\tt c:\textbackslash Document and Settings\textbackslash<username>}\\
      by default, and in Vista and above it is by default\\
      {\tt c:\textbackslash Users\textbackslash<username>}
      \item Open the TeX Live Manager dialog and select 'Update filename database' under 'Actions'.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Mac OS X}
% text
\begin{frame}{Installation}{Mac OS X}
  \begin{block}{Mac OS X with MacTeX}
     Place the {\tt <dirstruct>} in the root of your local latex directory tree. By default it is\\
        {\tt \textasciitilde /Library/texmf}\\
        If the root does not exist, create it. The symbol {\tt \textasciitilde} refers to your home folder, i.e., {\tt /home/<username>}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Required Packages}
% list of required packages
\begin{frame}{Installation}{Required Packages}
  Of course, you have to have the Beamer class installed. In addition, the theme loads two packages
  \begin{itemize}
    \item TikZ\footnote{By the way, TikZ is an awesome package for creating beautiful graphics. If you do not believe me, then have a look at these \chref{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/}{online examples} or the \chref{http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/pgf/base/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf}{pgf user manual}. If you want to create beautiful plots, you should use the pgfplots package which is based on TikZ.}
    \item calc
  \end{itemize}
  These packages are very common and should therefore be included in your latex distribution.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{User Interface}
\subsection{Loading the Theme and Theme Options}
% list of the themes and options
\begin{frame}{User Interface}{Loading the Theme and Theme Options}
  \begin{block}{The Presentation Theme}
    It is very simple to load the presentation theme. Just type\\
    {\tt \textbackslash usetheme[<options>]\{aausidebar\}}\\
    which is exactly the same way other beamer presentation themes are loaded. The presentation theme loads the inner, outer and color aausidebar theme files and passes the {\tt <options>} on to these files.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{The Inner Theme}
    You can load the inner theme directly by\\
    {\tt \textbackslash useinnertheme\{aausidebar\}}\\
    and it has no options.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% list of the themes and options
\begin{frame}{User Interface}{Loading the Theme and Theme Options}
  \begin{block}{The Outer Theme}
    You can load the outer theme directly by\\
    {\tt \textbackslash useoutertheme[<options>]\{aausidebar\}}\\
    Currently, the theme options are
  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt hidetitle}: Hide the (short) title in the sidebar
    \item {\tt hideauthor}: hide the (short) author in the sidebar
    \item {\tt hideinstitute}: hide the (short) institute in the bottom of the sidebar
    \item {\tt shownavsym}: show the navigation symbols
    \item {\tt width=<length>}: width of the sidebar (default is 2 cm). The width is measured from the right side of the vertical bar to the right edge of the slide.
    \item {\tt hideothersubsections}: hide all subsections but the subsections in the current section
    \item {\tt hideallsubsections}: hide all subsections
  \end{itemize}
  The last three options are inherited from the outer sidebar theme.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% list of the themes and options
{\setbeamercolor{frametitle}{use=structure,fg=structure.fg,bg=white}
\begin{frame}{User Interface}{Loading the Theme and Theme Options}
  \begin{block}{The Color Theme}
    You can load the color theme directly by\\
    {\tt \textbackslash usecolortheme[<options>]\{aausidebar\}}\\
    Currently, the only theme option is
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\tt lightheaderbg}: use a light header background (currently, it is white). 
    \end{itemize}
    This option creates the light header used on this slide.
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{The Color Element {\tt aau sidebar}}
    The color theme defines a new beamer color element named {\tt aau sidebar} whose foreground and background colors are
    \begin{itemize}
      \item fg: {\usebeamercolor[fg]{aau sidebar}light blue (\{rgb\}\{0.55,0.79,0.94\})}
      \item bg: {\usebeamercolor[bg]{aau sidebar}dark blue (\{rgb\}\{0.00,0.41,0.66\})}
    \end{itemize}
    Use can use these colors in the standard beamer way by using the command
    {\tt \textbackslash usebeamercolor[<fg or bg>]\{aau sidebar\}}. See the beamer manual for instructions.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% no sidebar on the left
\begin{frame}{User Interface}{Loading the Theme and Theme Options}
  Notice that the theme does not support a sidebar on the left which is the default of the outer sidebar theme. There are at least two reasons for this
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Most people read from left to right. Therefore the most important information, which is the main text, should be on the left.
    \item The AAU logo looks much better on the right than on the left.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Modifying the Theme}
% how to modify the theme
{\setbeamercolor{aau sidebar}{fg=gray!50,bg=gray}
 \setbeamercolor{sidebar}{bg=red!20}
 \setbeamercolor{frametitle}{use=structure,fg=structure.fg,bg=red!5}
 \setbeamercolor{structure}{fg=red}
 \setbeamercolor{normal text}{bg=gray!10}
\begin{frame}{User Interface}{Modifying the Theme}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> You can modify specific elements of the theme through the templates provided by the beamer class. Please refer to the beamer user manual for instructions.
    \item<2-> For example, on this slide we have used
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Change the sidebar colors:\\
        {\tt \textbackslash setbeamercolor\{aau sidebar\}\{fg=gray!20,bg=gray\}}
        {\tt \textbackslash setbeamercolor\{sidebar\}\{bg=red!20\}}
        \item Change the color of the structural elements:\\
        {\tt \textbackslash setbeamercolor\{structure\}\{fg=red\}}\\
        \item Change the frame title text color and background:
        {\tt \textbackslash setbeamercolor\{frametitle\}\{use=structure, fg=structure.fg,bg=red!5\}}
        \item Change the normal text color background:
        {\tt \textbackslash setbeamercolor\{normal text\}\{bg=gray!10\}}
      \end{itemize}
