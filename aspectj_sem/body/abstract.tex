Aspect Oriented Programming(AOP) can be viewed as a complement for Object Oriented Programming(OOP) with the ability to support \textsl{seperation of concerns}.There have been many implementations for AOP,among which Aspectj is the most well known.Aspectj is now an extension for java development toolkit and usually used as a plugin for IDEs like eclipse.Apart from most of the other tools,it uses the aspectj compiler(ajc) to weaving the advice into original source code statically on the bytecode level.This review is based on \cite{belblidia:towards} describes the operational semantics of aspectj's static advice weaving with a subset of Aspectj and Java Virtual Machine Language Instruction(JVMLI).
